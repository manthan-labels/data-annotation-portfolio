This project demonstrates my ability to perform video annotation using CVAT, focusing on two critical traffic classes: cars and traffic lights.  
I used bounding boxes for cars and polygons for traffic lights to showcase both speed and precision in annotation.

## Key Details
- Tool: CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)
- Data Type: Video (urban traffic footage)
- Classes: 
  - car (bounding box)
  - traffic_light (polygon)
- Annotation Style:
  - Bounding boxes → cars
  - Polygons → traffic lights
- Export Formats: YOLO TXT, Pascal VOC XML
- Frames Annotated: 19

## Highlights
- Demonstrated video annotation with frame interpolation in CVAT.
- Used polygon tool for precise labeling of small, irregular traffic signals.
- Exported dataset in multiple formats for client flexibility.
- Packaged dataset with clear folder structure.
