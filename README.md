# data-annotation-portfolio
## Overview: This repository showcases four sample annotation projects demonstrating my ability to create high‑quality datasets for computer vision tasks.
### 1. Cats vs Dogs (Image Annotation)
- *Tool:* LabelImg  
- *Classes:* cat, dog  
- *Annotation Style:* Bounding boxes  
- *Export Format:* Pascal VOC (XML), YOLO TXT
- *Highlights:* Clean, consistent annotations suitable for training object detection models.
### 2. Urban Traffic (Video Annotation)
- *Tool:* CVAT  
- *Classes:* car (bounding box), traffic_light (polygon)  
- *Annotation Style:* Video annotation with interpolation for efficiency  
- *Export Formats:* Pascal VOC (XML), YOLO TXT  
- *Highlights:* Demonstrated handling of both large objects (cars) and small, irregular objects (traffic lights).

## 3. Multi-Class Traffic Analysis
This repository contains a **multi‑class traffic video annotation dataset** created using **CVAT**.  
The dataset focuses on **urban traffic scenes**, with bounding box annotations for **cars, bikes, and pedestrians**.  
It demonstrates **dense labeling** with ~350 annotations across 13 frames, making it a compact but high‑value showcase for object detection and tracking tasks.

 Dataset Details
- **Frames Annotated**: 13  
- **Total Annotations**: ~350 bounding boxes  
- **Classes**:  
  - `car`  
  - `bike`  
  - `pedestrian`  
- **Annotation Tool**: [CVAT](https://cvat.ai)  
- **Annotation Type**: Bounding boxes (with tracking across frames)

 Export Formats
Annotations are provided in multiple formats:
- **Pascal VOC (XML)** → Native CVAT export  
- **YOLOv8 (TXT)** → Converted locally from VOC
